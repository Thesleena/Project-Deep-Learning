DL: Build and Train a CNN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we will create and train a deep learning model to classify these digits accurately. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to understand CNNs and their application .
